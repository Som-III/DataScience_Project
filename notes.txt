utils/helpers{return of load_json(path: Path) -> dict: instead of Confogbox
also same foor read_yaml}

configuration of entities

check if the config parts are read as str or dict or Any to ensure in configuration.py to ensure df.to_csv(self.config['data_ingestion']['local_data_file'])
this works or i would have to use os.path in configuration.py input of read_yaml
