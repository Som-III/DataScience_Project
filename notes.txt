utils/helpers{return of load_json(path: Path) -> dict: instead of Confogbox
also same foor read_yaml}

configuration of entities

check if the config parts are read as str or dict or Any to ensure in configuration.py to ensure df.to_csv(self.config['data_ingestion']['local_data_file'])
this works or i would have to use os.path in configuration.py input of read_yaml

i managed read_yaml to ---> exporting in configuration.py making sure dataclass matches
now in data_ingestion
 once dataclass exported things change completly in self 
 as in configuration.py type of config ---> (variable) config: Dict[str, Any]
 but in ingestion type of config -----> (variable) config: DataIngestionConfig due to self being-----> (parameter) self: Self@DataIngestion


Data ingestion done
